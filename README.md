# FEEQU

## Requirements
* To compile the code is it necesary to install the sfml library, this depends
 on the OS you are using.
* Right now the program expects to find the sprites in the folder img. I am 
not adding the images to the repository because it is a bad practice.
Instead I have added a file with the urls of the images that the program needs
